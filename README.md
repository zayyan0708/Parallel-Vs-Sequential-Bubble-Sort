# Parallel Vs Sequential Bubble Sort
 This project aims to compare the performance of parallel bubble sort against sequential bubble sort. The goal is to find out how efficient parallel bubble sort can perform against its sequential counterpart when sorting a large dataset of Employee Data.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient for large arrays.

## Parallel Computing
Parallel computing involves breaking a problem into smaller, independent parts that can be processed simultaneously. This approach allows for faster processing times and increased efficiency. Parallel computing is becoming increasingly popular due to advancements in hardware and software technology.

Conclusion
Parallel bubble sort is an efficient sorting algorithm for large arrays, and its performance is better than Serial bubble sort. However, for small arrays, the overhead associated with parallel computing outweighs the benefits, and sequential sorting algorithms perform better. The project highlights the benefits of parallel computing and its potential to improve the efficiency of various algorithms.
